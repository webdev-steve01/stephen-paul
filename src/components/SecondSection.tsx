  "At Hei, a startup launching in September, I developed a robust support page for our WhatsApp chatbot, designed the end-to-end chat flow, and integrated a payment gateway. The platform empowers students with instant, self-service access to campus information and paid services, streamlining common requests and reducing the need for human support..";
const NetflixDesc: string =
  "The goal was to master dynamic content loading and minimize load times while handling large datasets. I implemented server-side data fetching, caching strategies, and genre-based filtering to reduce browser strain. The interface is fully responsive, intuitive across devices, and delivers a fluid user experience. Note: Chrome might flag it for phishing due to the resemblance to Netflix â€” an unintended consequence.";
const cbtDesc: string =
  "Focused on performance and simplicity over responsiveness, the platform was intentionally built for desktops to support proctored environments. It features dynamic content rendering, clear navigation, and a no-distraction layout to ensure smooth exam-taking for candidates.";
